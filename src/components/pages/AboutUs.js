                The Tao can't be sung
                I long to know what is beyond me
                I try to change what I should not change
                Realistically optimistic
                I'm a philosopher, not, not a mystic
                No more playing now, I'm on a mission
                But I forgive a man if he doesn't listen
                I see Lucifer makes a good living
                A philosophy so limiting
                Everyone got decisions to make
                Oh, yeah, baby, got bills to pay
                The truth lies beyond what you see
                I'm not mad at you
                When I get my turn
                When I get my turn
                Staying on my toes
                Oh, they will see
                Forget everything you heard
                Forget everything you heard
                You don't know who's feeding it to you
                When I was sixteen
                When I was sixteen
                Nobody believed
                Music's for you
                When my turn it comes
                When my turn it comes
                I will tear the system apart
